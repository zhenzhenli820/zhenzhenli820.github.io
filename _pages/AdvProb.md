<font size="3"><font color="#0000dd">Why non-asymptotic probability?</font><br /></font><br />
In compressed sensing and high dimensional data science, isometric embedding plays an crucial role which lay its foundation upon non-asymptotical analysis of random matrices. It can be dated back to 1990s, Bai-yin law state that:...... More precisely,....

<font size="3"><font color="#0000dd">How to estabilish uniform bounds?</font><br /></font><br />
Covering Nets technique: to get uniformly bound (usually operator bound or uniformly for $S^{n-1}$), one can use $\epsilon$-Net to help establish such. More precisely, the uniform bound for all $S^{n-1}$ can be in the same order of bounds for $\epsilon$-Net. So in each point in the epsilon Net, we have a bound and a fail probability, we can have the uniform bound for all points in the $\epsilon$-Net and union fail probability(fail probability for each point times $\epsilon$-Net size). Once we have the union fail probability and due to uniform bound for $\epsilon$-Net, we can state under such fail probability, the uniform bounds for $S^{n-1}$ can be estimated.
